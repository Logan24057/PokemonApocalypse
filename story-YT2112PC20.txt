Fusion generator link - https://aegide.github.io/

treecko(276) - togekiss, dodrio, mr.mime, 

mudkip(282) - honegde, machop(we can use both evolution lines) 

torchic(279) - roselia(tochic and combusken, blaziken would be roserade), chinchou

Ideas:
Main Story;
-City destroyed after groudon and kyogres showdown
	- rayquaza never stopped the fight
		-A scientist or some group could be keeping him and using his moves as power 
	- The energy from their attacks could have caused a change in wild pokemon
		sub idea- if a scientist is holding rayquaza he could be experimenting on pokemon to see if he can make the ultimate pokemon
		- the journey could be going to find rayquaza 
			- the mc could find rayquaza dead
				- there could be some way to combine his power with another pokemon (such as a ditto) 
	- Groudon and kyogre could have both been defeated causing even more energy to be released into the wild
		- this energy could infect other legendary pokemon later in the story
			- the energy could infect dioxys making the pokemon aggressive
				- deoxys could attack rayquaza killing him
					- rayquaza could have left behind an evolution stone
					- or a type of egg
						- the end goal could be finding a working incubator for the egg
							- after the egg gets incubated dioxys could show up for the final boss fight
						- the egg could hatch towards the end of the story 
		- could also create new legendarys and shinys
-Main character could have been left behind after they evacuated the city
-Main character could have been the only survivor in the city 
Sub Ideas: 
- through the journey we could fight legendary pokemon who let off the energy that was spread
